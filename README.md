# Digital Ocean Kubernetes Challenge

## Project Description

_Deploy a solution for configuring Kubernetes "from the inside"_
Install Crossplane, which is like Terraform but you manage the infra from inside Kubernetes, not from outside. Crossplane is an open source Kubernetes add-on that enables platform teams to assemble infrastructure from multiple vendors, and expose higher level self-service APIs for application teams to consume, without having to write any code.
