# Journey

## Prequel

I came across the Digital Ocean Kubernetes Challenge via Twitter and thought _yeah, I should spend even more time in front of my computer!_
But then, how to decide for a challenge? Should I do an easy one? _I'm already doing complicated things at work, maybe go easy.._
While scrolling up and down, I decided to simply go for the last one. And this happened to be the **Crossplane** Challenge!

So here we are.

There were not many restrictions how to do that challenge, I decided to simply document my little journey through the challenge, so this is more a step by step guide, maybe with an roundup at the end.

## Part 1

As the description says _"like Terraform but you manage the infra from inside"_ I thought its a good idea to use Terraform at least for the provisioning of the cluster and basic Crossplane setup via Helm. (TODO Links)

As this is rather a simple and small project, without environments and dozens of modules, I just split the files by duty and we're good to go.

And since I'm awaiting the credits for the project, and my flatmate is already waiting with the pizza, I'll close for now.. :)
